# **1. Whatâ€™s the difference between Ansible and Terraform?**

- **Terraform** is declarative and mainly used for provisioning infrastructure (like VPCs, clusters, databases).
- **Ansible** is procedural and best for configuration management (like installing software, updating configs, or patching systems).
    
    In my work, I used **Terraform** to build infrastructure and **Ansible** for tasks like server configuration and automation scripts. They complement each other very well.
